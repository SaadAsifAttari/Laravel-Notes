So, there are so many files and folders in your Laravel project, so we'll understand some basic files and folders for beginners.

(1) We ran some commands in the [Laravel Project Create Steps.txt] file, so we have a small Laravel project in your workspace. Now, we want to open the project in the browser.

(2) First, open your XAMPP and start two things: Apache & MySQL because we need to start these two to open the project in the browser. After starting these two, now type this URL in your browser:
=> http://localhost/projectname/public/

(3) So, you can see the Laravel screen in your browser. In the top right corner, there are two links: [Login, Register]. Since you don't have an account, you can register to create one.

(4) If you register, you'll see that you're on your home page. If you log out and then type the home URL in your browser, the home page won't open; it will redirect you to the login page.

(5) So, there is your Laravel project. Now, let's find files in the project. I'll tell you about the main and basic things.

(6) In your project, the main folders are [app, public, resources & routes]. Let me explain what you have in these folders:
=> In your [Routes] folder, you have four files, but we'll talk about one. The file is web.php. This file helps you create URLs and display pages.
=> In your [Resources] folder, you have four other folders, but let's focus on one: the 'view' folder. In the 'View' folder, you can create blade files like [index.blade.php]. This file contains your HTML code.
=> In your [Public] folder, you can put your other files like [js, css, images & etc.].
=> In your [App] folder, you have five folders, but we'll talk about two: first, the 'Model', and then 'Http/Controllers'. But we'll discuss these folders later.

Thanks for using my notes. I think they'll be helpful for you. Now, you can explore your basic folders & files. We'll meet in the next file and learn about programming & databases.
